# DuckDuckGo
This user CCS adds small modifications to website appearance like setting hyperlink color and visted hyperlink color.
Also, those annoying reminders are gone.
I just find a more colorful theme easier to use and like some frequently visited sites to share somewhat similar appearance.
You may find this one useful or not.
